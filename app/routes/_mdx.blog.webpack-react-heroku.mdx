If you are starting on web-development in 2018, I am sure all or at least most of your frontend projects are by default built and bundled using **Webpack**. Webpack has sunk into almost all the frontend projects we use nowadays and we have a really strong online dev community around Webpack to support us. If you are a beginner or even an intermediate to Webpack, I highly recommend this [link](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.freecodecamp.org%2Fpart-1-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-4-562b1d231e75) to get started on adding Webpack to your working web application.

This post is mainly aimed at people who are already using Webpack applications in their personal, GitHub or even client projects to successfully deploy and host their web applications on **Heroku**.

If you are new to **Heroku**, please check out the [link](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heroku.com%2F) to read further.

> In this post, I am going to quickly cover how to make an existing **Webpack** application deployment ready, (irrespective of the frontend libraries **React** or **Vue** **JS**) and help deploy your code on your **Heroku** account, in three simple steps. I have also attached my code repo at the end of the post, please feel free to clone/fork and play around with it.

**_Assuming that you already have a working Webpack application, let’s get into making it deployment ready for Heroku._**

## 1. Build an express server

The first step is to build a simple express server to serve your application. _What is an Express server you ask?_

> An Express is a web-application framework that basically runs on a node environment. In our case it serves our application from a port available in the same environment.

This is all you need to know to get started with building an express server. Unlike full-fledged express web applications, we are not going to serve each page based on an express router (_it’s not really important to know what I am talking about tbh..!_ ). Instead, we are going to build a simple standard express server to serve our index.html file.

This code might seem repetitive across many other blogs because it pretty much is the standard for building a simple express web server. Create a server.js and copy- paste this code.

```js
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
const app = express();

// the __dirname is the current directory from where the script is running
app.use(express.static(__dirname));

// send the user to index html page inspite of the url
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "index.html"));
});

app.listen(port);
```

### Explanation

1.  **_\_\_dirname_** points to the current directory from where the **_server.js_** is being run from and that is treated as the root of your project.
2.  When we tell the express app to use a directory it automatically picks up the index.html file to serve.
3.  We have also added an extra check to redirect the users back to index.html to avoid ‘not found’ errors and for the sake of simplicity.

## 2. Webpack Production Build

This is a crucial step for us and it ensures that our application properly spits out a bundled js which we can use for deployment.

In the **Webpack-cli**, this is a simple one-liner, and it should spit out the output based on **_webpack.config.js_** we have.

webpack -p

In your **webpack.config.js** file, if you have the following code, you will see a **_bundle.js_** generated at the root of your application.

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: \[
    './src/index.js'
  \],
  output: {
    path: __dirname,
    publicPath: '/',
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
}
```

On the flip-side when you do not have this config setup, your output will be generated in a **_/dist_** folder under the name **_main.js_**.

In both the cases, we need an HTML file and the location of your index.html determines where your express application should point to. Let’s say if you generate your **_index.html_** inside your **_/dist_** folder using a **_\[htmlWebpackPlugin\]_**, then the code that points to express **_app.use_** should be modified in the following way

app.use(express.static(\_\_dirname + '/dist'));

In my case I do not use a **_\[htmlWebpackPlugin\]_**, instead I have a predefined **_index.html_** at the root of the folder where **_bundle.js_** is linked through the script tag.

> **Note**: At this stage if you are not clear on what I am talking about, please download the code repo at the end of this post and check out the **webpack.config.js** file.

## **3. Verify and deploy**

If you have successfully generated the bundled js file either in the **_/dist_** folder or in your custom location and made sure that your generated/pre-defined **_index.html_** has a script tag pointing to the bundled js**_(main.js / bundle.js), you are now ready to ready to deploy your application._**

But before we jump the guns and deploy we need to make sure that the express server properly serves the application to **localhost:8080.**

Run the following command in your terminal and verify if your application is being served on port 8080.

```bash
node server.js
```

Yes? Great, you are just two scripts away from deployment. No? verify your **s*erver.js*** and make sure that you are pointing to the right directory and also check your **_webpack.config.js_** to see where your bundled js is being generated.

Now that we are here finally, close to deployment, we need to add two lines of script in our **_package.json_** file. Add these two following commands under the scripts section.

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js", // serves the application
  "heroku-postbuild": "webpack -p" // runs after installation
},
```

**_Note_:** Please replace the existing **“start”** command with **“dev”** and continue running dev server using **npm run dev** instead of **start**.

### Explanation

> **Heroku** automatically installs all our dependencies and goes on to do a **post-build** operation before serving our application. In this post-build operation, we do the production bundling of our js files and allow Heroku to kick-start the application by running the **start** command.

Once you are done with the above, now let’s look at the deploying it to Heroku. Assuming that you already have a Heroku login and an account. Install the Heroku-cli following the instructions on this [link](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevcenter.heroku.com%2Farticles%2Fheroku-cli%23download-and-install).

_Once you have installed the Heroku-CLI, follow the instructions below to deploy from the command line one after another._

```bash
heroku login

heroku create

git init

heroku git:remote --app <your-heroku-app-name>

git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"

git push heroku master
```

### Explanation

1.  Heroku login prompts you to enter username and password.
2.  Heroku create command creates an application and gives you back the application URL and Heroku’s git repo for your project.
3.  Re-initialize your project by running git init.
4.  Add Heroku’s git repo as the remote repo of your current application.
5.  Git add and commit .
6.  Push to Heroku’s git repository.

Visit your application URL generated at step 2, during Heroku create, you should be able to view your application. Voila !! your app is deployed :)

## Conclusion

This should work for all the **Webpack** applications, irrespective of their frontend library, based on your web pack config file. The key thing to note here is your **_package.json_** file, make sure all the dependencies and dev-dependancies are part of it including **Webpack**.

I have created a **_Webpack 4 boilerplate with react and express server_** on my Github, please feel free to fork the code and try to run all the commands I have mentioned above.
