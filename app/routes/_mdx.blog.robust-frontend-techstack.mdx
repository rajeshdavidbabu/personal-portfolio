title: "A Quick Guide On Choosing A Robust Frontend Tech Stack"
---

At the time of writing this article, the frontend world is still a _wild west_ of technologies and architectures. Although we have several approaches, frameworks, libraries, languages and environments at our disposal, not all of them are scalable and robust.

Hence, we have to have some sense of awareness and responsibility while choosing a tech stack and this article is going to help with that.

## Choosing Core Technologies

An application architecture consists of several parts that make our application meaningful, extensible and deployable. Whilst building a frontend architecture, it's of utmost importance to choose a _core library_ and a _core language_ before we choose the rest of the tech stack.

What do I mean by that?

**Core library or framework** is the platform on which we are going to build our frontend applications, for example — *React, Vue, Angular and Svelte etc*.

**Core language,** on the other hand, is the language that we are going to use to build it— namely _Javascript, Typescript and Coffeescript_ _etc_.

All our additional development tools need to complement and work in unison with these two _entities/technologies_, if not, we are going to hit roadblocks down the line and it will also take a toll on our _developer-experience_.

There are several factors that are involved in choosing _core technologies_, but I ideally stick to 3 important ones —

- **Market Share**— This enables us to find better developers from a large pool of skilled developers in that technology. [_State Of JS_](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2F2020.stateofjs.com%2Fen-US%2F) can give you a better understanding. _Eg:_ At the time of writing this article, _React_ still holds the largest market share.
- **Opinionatedness** — How [_opinionated_](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F802050%2Fwhat-is-opinionated-software%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAn%2520opinionated%2520framework%2520is%2520one%2Cmade%2520by%2520the%2520framework%2520designer.) is the library/framework when you compare it to general web development. _Eg:_ _React_ is less opinionated than _Angular_ and it offers a [_minimal API surface_](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2F2014.jsconf.eu%2Fspeakers%2Fsebastian-markbage-minimal-api-surface-area-learning-patterns-instead-of-frameworks.html).
- **Future Proof** — How long can the code-base live without turning into [_spaghetti_](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sitepoint.com%2Fwrite-maintainable-javascript%2F). This goes in hand-in-hand with _scalability_ and the ability of the code to stay _standard_ over time. _Eg:_ [_Typescript_](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monocubed.com%2Ftypescript-vs-javascript%2F) code-base scales better when working with larger teams.

The choice of technology always comes with its own pros and cons, however to some degree,

> you have to be opinionated and intelligently biased towards the tools you use.

## Building A Frontend Architecture

With the above factors in mind, I have chosen the following core technologies  
 **React** — *Core library*  
 **Typescript** — *Core language*

The following illustration offers a simple perspective into building a simple yet scalable frontend architecture around our chosen core technologies.

## Finally — Our Tech Stack

With the aforementioned architecture in mind, let’s take a quick look at the tech stack that could help us achieve it —

### Environment

**_node(v14+)_** and **_npm(v7+)_** — development and package _environment_.

### Core Libraries

**_react.js(v17+)_** — *core library* for the project.  
**_react-dom_** — dom APIs for react.  
**_react-router-dom_** — client-side routing for react.  
**_recoil_** — hooks based state-management for react.   
**_react-hook-form_** — form library based on hooks.   
**_react-error-boundary_** — error boundary to catch rendering errors.

### Core Language

**_typescript(v4+)_** — *core language* used for development.

### Bundler

**_webpack(v5)_** — helps us _bundle_ our project into single/multiple js chunks.  
**_webpack-cli_** — enables us to use the webpack command in the npm scripts.  
**_webpack-dev-server_** — enables us to run webpack development server.  
**_html-webpack-plugin_** — enables us to generate a final HTML using a template.  
**_fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin_** — enables us to type-check the code during the build process.  
**_eslint-webpack-plugin_** — enables us to catch linting errors during the build process.  
**_clean-web-pack-plugin_** — enables us to clean existing build folders before the start of the build process.  
**_babel-loader_** — babel module loader for webpack.  
**_ts-node_** — helps node environment to run TS files.

#### Transpiler

**_@babel/core(v7+)_** — helps us _transpile_ our JS compatible with old browsers and new browsers with its support libraries —   
**_@babel/preset-react_** — enables us to use the latest JS features and will also use _browserslist_ from _package.json_ while transpiling code for the target browsers.  
@**_babel/preset-react_** and @**_babel/preset-typescript_** — enables us to transform React and Typescript code into JS.  
**_@babel/plugin-transform-runtime_** — enables us to save on code size, remove some duplicates in our code, and add polyfills where required.  
**_@babel/runtime-corejs3_** — runtime corejs polyfills on production bundle.

#### Linter

**_eslint(v7+)_** — *linter* for our ecmascript.  
**_eslint-config-prettier_** — turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with prettier.  
**_eslint-plugin-prettier_** — runs prettier as an eslint rule and reports differences as individual eslint issues.  
**_eslint-plugin-react_** — runs react specific eslint rules.  
**_eslint-plugin-react-hooks_** — runs react hooks rules for eslint.  
**_@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin_** — enables eslint for TS code.  
**_@typescript-eslint/parser_** — enables parsing of TS.

### Formatter

**_prettier(v2+)_** — *formatter* that works with eslint plugins.

### Test Environment

**_jest_** — test environment to build and run our unit and snapshot tests.  
**_@testing-library/react_** — complete React DOM testing utilities.  
**_@testing-library/dom_** — simple and complete DOM testing utilities.  
**_@testing-library/jest-dom_** — custom jest matchers to test the state of the DOM.  
**_@testing-library/user-event_** — fires user events for our test cases.

### Internationalization

**_i18next_** — internationalization framework for JS.  
**_i18next-browser-languagedetector_** — helps us detect browser language.  
**_react-i18next_** — internationalization APIs for react.

### Component Library

**_@chakra-ui/react_** — component library helper to build reusable components.
**_@emotion/styled_** —styled APIs for emotion-based react components.
**_@emotion/react_** — css-in-js library for react.
**_@framer-motion_** — animation library for react.
**_@chakra/icons_** — icon package for chakra-ui.

## Conclusion

In this _tech-stack_ above not all of them are production _dependencies_, only some are, for example — react, its supporting libraries, internationalization, chakra-ui and @babel/runtime-corejs3 are dependencies. And everything else is a [_development dependency_](https://medium.com/@dylanavery720/npmmmm-1-dev-dependencies-dependencies-8931c2583b0c#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20these%20two,are%20also%20required%20at%20runtime.).

Hopefully, this quick guide enables you to build your tech stack for your next project.
