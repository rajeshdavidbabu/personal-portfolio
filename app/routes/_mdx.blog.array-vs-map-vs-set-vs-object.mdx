title: Use cases for Array vs Set vs Map vs Object
---

The internet is a great place to find information, but there is one teeny-tiny problem. You are on a boat in the middle of a deep blue sea. Although most of us do not venture all the way down into the darkness, we still precisely like to get what we want.

_As frontend developers most of the times we do not rely on vanilla javascript for everything that we want. Most of the times we pledge our allegiance to our lords (frameworks) and libraries and follow them blindly because we think that they are capable of doing everything, sometimes losing out on javascript best practices._

Recently, I got the chance to work on a backbone application where _I understood the primary importance of selectively using javascript built-in objects for our operations regardless of the framework_. And got to learn the built-in data-structures of our JS ecosystem and thought about putting all of them down in writing.

## 1\. Search/Find

Let’s look at how we can find a particular element in all the four built-in javascript objects for different use-cases.

### Array

```js
// array of objects

array.find((object) => object.id === 2); // returns object with id 2//array of numbers starting from "zero"

array.indexOf("one"); // returns 1 as index
```

### Object

```js
// array of Objects

// eg: [{id: 1, name: "one"},...] can be converted to {1: {name: "one"}, ... }

object[2]; // returns the value of key 2 (i.e {name: "two"}
```

> Note: When using n-operations to find an object, its always best to use object key for retrieving the item rather than array find. Checkout the [Benchmark Results](https://www.measurethat.net/Benchmarks/Show/8079/0/object-key-access-vs-array-find#latest_results_block).

### Set

Sets have no built-in function to retrieve or find the index of its items even-though its an iterable, so ideally we would have to convert it to an array before indexOf/find operation.

```js

const mySet = new Set(['1', '2', '3']);

[...mySet].indexOf('2') // returns 1const mySet = new Set([{1: 'one'}, {2: 'two'}, {3: 'three'}]);

[...mySet].find(object => object[2] === 'two'); // returns {2: 'two'}

```

### Map

Maps are special objects per se, they are iterables with key value pair constructor that looks like a 2D array but acts like an object. They offer a better flexibility in terms of choosing our key values. A map can have a key value which can be a string, number, object or even NaN.

```js
var map = new Map([
  [1, "one"],
  [2, "two"],
]);

map.get(1); // returns 'one'
```

> **Note**: Maps can be very flexible in places where objects can be a bit annoying, and it strongly serves the purpose in some specific scenarios, like adding and deleting key-pairs frequently.

## 2\. Sort

Sort operations can be interesting, and most of the times we assume that sort over an iterable entity works out of the box. Well, it doesn’t always.

### Array

Array sorts are often misunderstood by both beginners and intermediate developers. Since array’s default sort sorts an array based on `Unicode` , we cannot expect to get same sort behaviour for all the datatypes. Hence, we often need to pass a comparator function into the sort.

```js
// array of strings in a uniform case without special characters

const arr = ["sex", "age", "job"];

arr.sort(); //returns ["age", "job", "sex"]// array of numbers

const arr = [30, 4, 29, 19];

arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); // returns [4, 19, 29, 30]// array of number strings

const arr = ["30", "4", "29", "19"];

arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); // returns ["4", "19", "29", "30"]// array of mixed numerics

const arr = [30, "4", 29, "19"];

arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); // returns ["4", "19", 29, 30]// array of non-ASCII strings and also strings

const arr = ["réservé", "cliché", "adieu"];

arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b)); // returns is ['adieu', 'cliché','réservé']// array of objects

const arr = [
  { name: "Sharpe", value: 37 },

  { name: "And", value: 45 },

  { name: "The", value: -12 },
];

// sort by name string

arr.sort((a, b) => a["name"].localeCompare(b["name"])); // sort by value number

arr.sort((a, b) => a["value"] - b["value"]);
```

> Note: I usually prefer using [localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare) to sort my strings as they offer more flexibility of controlling case-sensitivity, accent and also give us the benefit of considering language during the sort.

### Object

There is no built-in method for the sorting of the objects, but ES6 offers some interesting built-in key-sorting during the creation of the object. Object keys are sorted only based on numerics/numeric-strings, all the other keys are pushed right after the numeric keys unsorted.

```js
// object with numeric/numeric-string keys are sorted

const obj = { 30: "dad", 4: "kid", 19: "teen", 100: "grams" };

console.log(obj); // returns {4: "kid", 19: "teen", 30: "dad", 100: "grams"} with sorted keys// object with key-values as alpha-strings are not sorted

const obj = { b: "two", a: "one", c: "three" };

console.log(obj); // returns {b: "two", a: "one", c: "three"}// object with numeric, numeric-string and alpha keys are partially sorted. (i.e only numeric keys are sorted)

const obj = { b: "one", 4: "kid", 30: "dad", 9: "son", a: "two" };

console.log(obj); // returns {4: "kid", 9: "son", 30: "dad", b: "one", a: "two"}
```

### Set

Sets do not have built-in sort functionality, however the easiest way to sort a set is to convert it to an array and implementing array’s sort method. Since, set is an iterable object, we can build our own sorting algorithm of our choice.

```js
// set to array and array sort

const set = new Set(["b", "a", "c"]);

[...set].sort(); // returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] which is an array// alternatively we can use entries to sort a set and create a new sorted set. The iterator gives us the ['a', 'a'] when spread over an array.

const set = new Set(["b", "a", "c"]);

const sortedSet = new Set([...set.entries()].map((entry) => entry[0]).sort());
```

> Note: Keep in mind that sort method is of array’s and you would have to use a comparator appropriately to get your desired sort.

### Map

Similar to sets maps do not have a built-in method themselves, but we can still spread their entries over an array and build a new sorted map.

```js
// entries spread over an array can be sorted like an array

const map = new Map([
  ["c", "three"],
  ["a", "one"],
  ["b", "two"],
]);

const sortedMap = new Map([...map.entries()].sort()); // returns sorted Map(3) {"a" => "one", "b" => "three", "c" => "two"}
```

> Note: In the map sorting, it is important to know that the two-dimensional array from the map gets sorted based on the first element in each sub-array. Here the sorting is based on “a”, “b” and “c” strings. If these were numbers, you would have to use a comparator.

## 3\. Includes or Has

One of the most important features of the iterable objects is to check the presence of the desired item. Almost, all of the built-in standard and iterable javascript objects have their own implementation to achieve this. Let’s look at them below.

### Array

```js
// we are considering a linear array only

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.includes(1); // returns true

arr.includes("1"); // returns false as types do not match
```

### Object

```js
// we are going to consider only the keys

const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, 1: "one" };

obj.hasOwnProperty("a"); // returns true

obj.hasOwnProperty("1"); // returns true because no type check

obj.hasOwnProperty(1); // returns true
```

### Set

Set has a handy ‘has’ function which can be more efficient in accessing the values compared to an array.

```js
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

set.has(4); // returns true

set.has("4"); // returns false because of mismatch in type
```

### Map

Map has a built-in ‘has’ function too.

```js
const map = new Map([
  [3, "three"],
  ["a", "one"],
  ["b", "two"],
]);

map.has("a"); // returns true

map.has(3); // returns true

map.has("3"); // returns false because types don't match
```

> Note: Compared to the array’s includes function, Object’s hasOwnProperty and Set/Map’s has functions seem to perform close to O(1) in different tests, clearly more efficient in terms of larger data sets.

## 4\. Removing Duplicates

There is no straight forward way to remove duplicates in a collection, given that array or object is linear, we can use some of the built-in methods to remove duplicates.

### Array

There are many online methods to remove duplicates from an array. That this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicate-values-from-js-array) thread covers. However in ES6 let’s look at the easiest ways of removing duplicates from an array.

```js
// considering a linear array Set gives us the answer we need.

const arr = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5];

[...new Set(arr)]; // returns [1, 2, 4, 5]// however set doesn't remove duplicates from array of objects

const arr = [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { a: 1 }];

[...new Set(arr)]; // returns [{a:1},{b:2},{a:1}]// hence we can use ES6 filter and map functions to achieve the same

arr.filter((obj, index) => {
  return arr.map((obj) => obj["a"]).indexOf(obj["a"]) === index;
}); // removes duplicate based on the key 'a'
```

> Note: Set will remove the duplicate objects if they are stringified and the strings match, but we still have to parse then back to the object once set is converted back to an array. The whole process might not be performant.

### Object

Objects do not allow duplicate key values, old values are overwritten by the new values.

```js
const obj = { b: "one", a: "two", a: "three" };

console.log(obj); // returns {b: "one", a: "three"}
```

### Set

Sets inherently do not allow duplicate values when they are passed a linear iterable object like an array, but when they are passed an array of object they do allow duplicate objects.

```js
// a linear array iterableconst set = new Set([1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5]);

console.log(set); // returns Set {1, 2, 4, 5}// array of objects

const set = new Set([{ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { a: 1 }]);

console.log(set); // returns Set {{a:1},{b:2},{a:1}} with duplicate objects
```

### Map

Maps also do not allow duplicate keys during the creation.

```js
const map = new Map([
  [3, "three"],
  [2, "two"],
  [2, "four"],
]);

console.log(map); // returns {3 => "three", 2 => "four"}
```

## 5\. Delete

### Array

Array has no built-in method to delete its items. However we can use couple of methods to do it. Splice, indexOf or filter.

```js
_; // I personally prefer this method._

const arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

arr.filter((e) => e !== "c"); // returns [ 'a', 'b' ] removing 'c'
```

### Object

Objects do not have a built-in delete method, but according to the docs we can use the `delete` keyword to delete a key. However, this is widely discouraged in the javascript community and even libraries like underscore and lodash use a different method.

```js
// The infamous delete methodconst obj = { b: "one", a: "two" };

delete obj.a; // deletes a and returns true
```

### Set

Set offers a built-in delete method making our lives easier

```js
const set = new Set([1, 2, 4, 5]);

set.delete(4); // deletes 4 and returns trueset.delete('5'); // returns false as types do not match
```

### Map

Map has its own built-in delete method to remove keys from a given map object.

```js

const map = new Map([[3, 'three'], [2, 'two']);

map.delete(3); // deletes [3, 'three'] and returns true.

map.delete('2'); // returns false as types do not match

```

## 6. Length and Size

```js
// arrays have a built-in property for length which is different from collection size.

["1", "2", "3"].length; // returns 3// objects have no built-in property to check length or size, so we need to resort to using keys array to check length.

Object.keys({ b: "one", a: "two", c: "three" }).length; // returns 3// set has a size property built-in

new Set([{ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { a: 1 }]).size; // returns 3// map has a size property built-in

new Map([
  [3, "three"],
  ["a", "one"],
  ["b", "two"],
]).size; // returns 3
```

## Conclusion

These are some of the key pointers to remember when choosing the standard built-in objects of your choice. Though javascript offers us the flexibility of using more than one built-in objects, its always better to choose the one that suits the best.
